A program in js is run by an engine for example V8 from Google Chrome.
The engine has memory heap and call stack.
Everything, like a new variable, is stored in memory heap. Unused things in memory heap are called memory leak.
Call stack read and execute the code.

JS is a single threaded language(only one call stack where you can execute one statement at a time)
which can be non blocking(asynchronous like setTimeout) 
-> for this we need a runtime javascript environment which has Web apis, callback queue and event loop
Event loop check if the call stack is empty
In call stack the principle is first in - last out
